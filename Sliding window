sliding windows is a technique used for iterating through a finite data set, typically an array or strings in a specific
controlled way. It involves creating a windows creating a window, which is a subset of the data, that "slides" through the
larger data set, typically one element at a time, while performing a specific operation on each subset of the data.

This technique is commonly used in algorithms like finding subarrays with a specific sum.

2 types of sliding windows
1. fixed size
2. variable size

1. Fixed Size Sliding Window:
    The general steps to solve these questions by following below steps:
        Find the size of the window required, say K.
        Compute the result for 1st window, i.e. include the first K elements of the data structure.
        Then use a loop to slide the window by 1 and keep computing the result window by window.
2. Variable Size Sliding Window:
    The general steps to solve these questions by following below steps:
        In this type of sliding window problem, we increase our right pointer one by one till our condition is true.
        At any step if our condition does not match, we shrink the size of our window by increasing left pointer.
        Again, when our condition satisfies, we start increasing the right pointer and follow step 1.
        We follow these steps until we reach to the end of the array.
